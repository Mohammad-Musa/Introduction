# ReadMe File

>In this exercise we practiced on how to work with _**Markdown**_ file in _**Visual Studio Code**_,  
After we edited the files in _**Visual Studio Code**_ the we pushed them by _**Gitkraken**_ to the related repository in _**Github**_.

>##### _We went through the below steps to get this work done:_
1. We create a new folder on the local disc.
2. On **Github** we create a new repository without a _readme_ file.
3. Then we copy the link for this repository to use it later with **Gitkraken**.
4. After that we open **Gitkraken** then we click _start a local repo_ and then we fill a name, in the next box _initialize in_ we select the folder that we created on our local disc and finally we past the link that we already copied from **Github** in the next box.
5. We go back to the repository which we created on **Github** and we click on setting then we scroll down until _source_ and we select _master branch_ from there.  
After that we will get a new link on the top of the repository window, we copy tis link.
6. We open **Gitkraken** again we clicked the + on the _remote_ and we pate the link on there to add a remote.
7. Now we _stage all changes_ then we add _commit_ and finally we click on _push_ to upload all the new changes to the _remote branch_.
